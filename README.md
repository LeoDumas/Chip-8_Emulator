# Chip-8 Emulator

A simple Chip-8 emulator written in C++.

## Description

This project demonstrates a minimal Chip-8 emulator. It includes:

- Loading a character set (the built-in font sprites for digits and letters).
- Loading ROM files (Chip-8 programs) from disk into memory.
- Basic opcode implementations (e.g., CLS, RET, JP, CALL, SE, SNE, LD, ADD, OR, AND, XOR, etc.) *(not finished yet)*.

The goal of this project is to provide a foundation for emulating and experimenting with classic Chip-8 games and demos, and understand how emulation works for futur projects.

## Features

- **LoadCharSet**: Loads the 16 built-in Chip-8 characters into memory.
- **LoadRom**: Loads a `.ch8` file into memory at the default `START_ADDRESS` (0x200 at the moment).
- **Basic Opcodes**: Includes implementations for many core Chip-8 instructions:
  - `CLS` (0x00E0)
  - `RET` (0x00EE)
  - `JP` (0x1nnn)
  - `CALL` (0x2nnn)
  - `SE Vx, byte` (0x3xkk)
  - `SNE Vx, byte` (0x4xkk)
  - `SE Vx, Vy` (0x5xy0)
  - `LD Vx, byte` (0x6xkk)
  - `ADD Vx, byte` (0x7xkk)
  - `LD Vx, Vy` (0x8xy0)
  - `OR Vx, Vy` (0x8xy1)
  - `AND Vx, Vy` (0x8xy2)
  - `XOR Vx, Vy` (0x8xy3)
  - `ADD Vx, Vy` (0x8xy4)
  - `SUB Vx, Vy` (0x8xy5)
  - `SHR Vx {, Vy}` (0x8xy6)
  
- **Stack**: Utilizes a 16-level stack for subroutine calls.

## Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler that supports C++17 or later (g++ or clang++).
- CMake (optional, if you want to use the provided `CMakeLists.txt` generated by QtCreator).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LeoDumas/Chip-8_Emulator.git
   cd Chip-8_Emulator
   ```

2. **Build**  
   Using CMake:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```
   Alternatively, you can compile the project directly:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o chip8_emulator
   ```

3. **Run**  
   ```bash
   ./chip8_emulator
   ```

## ROMs

In the sample code, the `Clock_Program_[Bill_Fisher_1981].ch8` file is loaded by default.

**Important**: This `.ch8` file comes from the following repository, which provides various Chip-8 ROMs:

> [https://github.com/kripod/chip8-roms](https://github.com/kripod/chip8-roms)

Feel free to place other Chip-8 ROM files in this project’s folder (or any convenient location) and load them using the `LoadRom()` function.

## Memory Layout

- **Start Address (0x200)**: Chip-8 programs generally begin at memory location 0x200. Some require 0x600 for ETI 660-based systems.
- **Fontset Address (0x50)**: The fontset is loaded at 0x50 in memory by default.

## Further Development

- Implement additional opcodes (e.g., 8xy4 to 8xyE, Fx07, Fx15, Fx18, etc.).
- Add graphics rendering (using SDL2, for example) to draw the 64x32 screen.
- Add a keyboard handling mechanism for Chip-8 keypad inputs.
- Add handling for the delay timer and sound timer.
- Optimize the instruction cycle and timing for smoother emulation.
